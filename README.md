The purpose of this project is to provide a comprehensive overview of the cryptocurrencies 
available in the market. Crypto dashboard enables the users to access the application through 
a secure login, allowing them to explore various cryptocurrencies and retrieve real-time 
market prices. 
Crypto dashboard includes a graph illustrating price fluctuations, trade volumes, and 
historical data for multiple cryptocurrencies. It aids users in analyzing market trends, 
identifying patterns, and guiding investment strategies effectively. 
The platform allows users to view cryptocurrency prices in USD and INR, facilitating easy 
comparisons across global monetary standards. This feature enables real-time monitoring, 
assessing fluctuations, and making informed decisions by converting crypto values to 
preferred fiat currencies. 
It is worth noting that the authentication process is seamlessly managed through Amazon 
Cognito. To access the Crypto Dashboard, users are encouraged to register and subsequently 
sign into their accounts, ensuring a secure and user-friendly experience
